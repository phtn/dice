# Game History Integration

The blackjack game now has full game history integration with local storage persistence.

## Features Added

### 1. Automatic Game Saving
- Every completed game is automatically saved to localStorage
- Includes all hand details, bet amounts, and results
- Tracks both individual hand results and overall game outcome

### 2. Context Integration
The BlackjackContext now provides these new methods:

```typescript
// Get complete game history
const history = getGameHistory();

// Get aggregated statistics
const stats = getHistoryStats();
// Returns: { totalGames, totalWins, totalLosses, totalPushes, totalBlackjacks, totalWinnings, winRate, averageWinnings, biggestWin, biggestLoss }

// Get recent games (default 10)
const recentGames = getRecentGames(5);

// Clear all history
clearGameHistory();

// Export history as JSON string
const exportedData = exportGameHistory();
```

### 3. Data Structure
Each game entry includes:
- Unique ID and timestamp
- Complete player hand details (cards, values, bet amounts, results)
- Dealer hand details
- Overall game result
- Financial summary (total bet, total winnings, net profit/loss)

### 4. Storage Management
- Automatically limits to 100 most recent games
- Handles localStorage errors gracefully
- Provides export/import functionality for data backup

### 5. Statistics Tracking
- Win/loss/push counts
- Blackjack frequency
- Total winnings/losses
- Win rate percentage
- Average winnings per game
- Biggest wins and losses

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { useBlackjackCtx } from './blackjack-ctx';

function GameHistoryComponent() {
  const { getGameHistory, getHistoryStats, clearGameHistory } = useBlackjackCtx();
  
  const history = getGameHistory();
  const stats = getHistoryStats();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Game Statistics</h3>
      <p>Games Played: {stats.totalGames}</p>
      <p>Win Rate: {stats.winRate.toFixed(1)}%</p>
      <p>Total Winnings: ${stats.totalWinnings}</p>
      
      <h3>Recent Games</h3>
      {history.slice(0, 5).map(game => (
        <div key={game.id}>
          <p>Result: {game.overallResult}</p>
          <p>Net: ${game.netWinnings}</p>
          <p>Date: {new Date(game.timestamp).toLocaleDateString()}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
      
      <button onClick={clearGameHistory}>Clear History</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Game Saving
Games are saved in the `processGameEnd` function of the BlackjackContext:

```typescript
// Save game to history
GameHistoryManager.saveGame(updatedHands, dealerHand, overallResult, totalWinAmount);
```

### Storage Key
Games are stored under the key: `'blackjack-game-history'`

### Error Handling
- localStorage errors are caught and logged
- Graceful fallback to empty arrays when storage is unavailable
- Import/export validation prevents data corruption

## Testing
Comprehensive test suite covers:
- Game saving and retrieval
- Statistics calculation
- Export/import functionality
- Storage limits
- Display formatting
- Error handling

All tests pass with proper localStorage mocking for the test environment.
