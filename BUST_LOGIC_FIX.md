# 🎯 Blackjack Bust Logic Fix

## 🚨 Issues Fixed

### **1. UI Issue: Disabled Split Button**
- ❌ **Before**: Split button always shown, even when disabled
- ✅ **After**: Split button only appears when splitting is possible

### **2. Game Logic Issue: Incorrect Bust Handling**
- ❌ **Before**: When player busts, dealer still plays their hand
- ✅ **After**: When player busts, dealer wins immediately (no hole card reveal needed)

## 🎰 Real Casino Rules

### **Player Bust = Immediate Loss**
In real blackjack:
1. **Player hits and busts** → Dealer wins immediately
2. **No hole card reveal** needed
3. **No dealer play** required
4. **Player loses bet** instantly

### **Mixed Scenarios (Splits)**
- **All hands bust** → Dealer wins all, no dealer play
- **Some hands bust** → Dealer plays for remaining hands
- **Busted hands lose** immediately, regardless of dealer outcome

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### **UI Fix: Conditional Split Button**
```tsx
// Before: Always shown
<Button onClick={split} disabled={!canSplit}>SPLIT</Button>

// After: Only shown when available
{canSplit && (
  <Button onClick={split}>SPLIT</Button>
)}
```

### **Game Logic Fix: Proper Bust Handling**
```typescript
// Before: Always compared with dealer
const result = engine.determineWinner(hand, dealerHand);

// After: Check bust first
if (hand.isBust) {
  result = 'dealer-wins';
  // No need to compare with dealer
} else {
  result = engine.determineWinner(hand, dealerHand);
}
```

### **Dealer Play Logic**
```typescript
// Check if all hands are busted
const checkIfAllHandsBusted = (hands: PlayerHand[]): boolean => {
  return hands.every(hand => hand.isBust);
};

// Skip dealer play if all players busted
if (checkIfAllHandsBusted(playerHands)) {
  processGameEnd(); // End immediately
} else {
  dealerPlay(); // Dealer must play
}
```

## 🧪 New Tests Added

### **Bust Logic Tests** (`bust-logic.test.ts`)
- ✅ Player bust = immediate dealer win
- ✅ All hands bust = no dealer play needed
- ✅ Mixed results = dealer plays for non-busted hands
- ✅ Bust with blackjack scenarios
- ✅ Ace conversion leading to bust
- ✅ Bust detection accuracy

### **Key Test Scenarios**
1. **Simple Bust**: K+Q+5 = 25 → Dealer wins
2. **All Hands Bust**: Multiple splits all bust → No dealer play
3. **Mixed Results**: Some bust, some don't → Dealer plays
4. **Bust vs Blackjack**: Player bust takes precedence
5. **Ace Conversion**: A+6+5+10 = 22 → Proper bust detection

## 🎯 Game Flow Improvements

### **Before (Incorrect)**
1. Player hits and busts (25)
2. Dealer reveals hole card
3. Dealer plays their hand (hits on 16, etc.)
4. Compare final hands
5. Dealer wins

### **After (Correct)**
1. Player hits and busts (25)
2. **Game ends immediately**
3. **Dealer wins** (no hole card reveal needed)
4. **No dealer play** required
