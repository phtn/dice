# Bust State Reversion Fix

## Problem
After the bust card display fix, a new bug appeared:
1. Player hits and busts
2. Busting card is displayed correctly
3. Hand value reverts to pre-bust value
4. Game declares player as winner instead of busted

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by **stale closure** in the setTimeout callback:

```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE
if (newHand.isBust) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    // These variables are from the closure and might be stale
    const nextPlayableIndex = findNextPlayableHand(activeHandIndex + 1, updatedHands);
    if (checkIfAllHandsBusted(updatedHands)) {
      processGameEnd(); // Uses old state!
    }
  }, 1000);
}
```

### What Was Happening:
1. `setPlayerHands(updatedHands)` updates React state
2. `setTimeout` captures `updatedHands` in closure
3. After 1 second, callback executes with potentially stale data
4. Functions like `processGameEnd()` use current React state (which might differ from closure)
5. State conflict causes hand to revert to pre-bust value

## Solution
Created a separate `handlePostBust` callback that uses current state:

```typescript
const handlePostBust = useCallback(() => {
  // Uses current playerHands state, not stale closure
  const nextPlayableIndex = findNextPlayableHand(activeHandIndex + 1, playerHands);
  
  if (nextPlayableIndex !== -1) {
    setActiveHandIndex(nextPlayableIndex);
  } else {
    if (checkIfAllHandsBusted(playerHands)) {
      processGameEnd(); // Uses current state
    } else {
      dealerPlay();
    }
  }
}, [activeHandIndex, playerHands, findNextPlayableHand, checkIfAllHandsBusted, processGameEnd, dealerPlay]);

// In hit function:
if (newHand.isBust) {
  setTimeout(handlePostBust, 1000); // Uses current state when executed
}
```

## Key Improvements
1. **No stale closures** - `handlePostBust` always uses current React state
2. **Proper dependency array** - React will update the callback when dependencies change
3. **Clean separation** - Post-bust logic is isolated and testable
4. **State consistency** - No conflicts between closure and React state

## User Experience
### Before Fix:
1. Player hits and busts → ✅ Card shows
2. Hand value reverts → ❌ Shows pre-bust value  
3. Game declares winner → ❌ Wrong result

### After Fix:
1. Player hits and busts → ✅ Card shows
2. Hand stays busted → ✅ Correct bust value
3. Game declares dealer wins → ✅ Correct result

## Technical Notes
- Uses `useCallback` with proper dependencies
- Avoids complex state manipulation in timeouts
- Maintains the 1-second delay for visual feedback
- Preserves all existing game logic and rules
