# 🎴 Blackjack Dealing Order Fix

## 🚨 Issue Identified
Our initial implementation had **incorrect dealing order**:
- ❌ **Wrong**: Player gets 2 cards, then Dealer gets 2 cards
- ✅ **Correct**: Player → Dealer → Player → Dealer (alternating)

## 🏆 Casino Standard Dealing Protocol

### **Proper Blackjack Dealing Order**
1. **Player gets 1st card** (face up)
2. **Dealer gets 1st card** (face up)  
3. **Player gets 2nd card** (face up)
4. **Dealer gets 2nd card** (face down - "hole card")

### **Why This Matters**
- **Fairness**: Ensures neither player nor dealer gets advantage
- **Casino Compliance**: Matches real blackjack rules
- **Card Counting**: Affects card counting accuracy
- **Game Integrity**: Maintains proper randomization

## 🔧 Fix Implementation

### **Before (Incorrect)**
```typescript
// Wrong: Batch dealing
for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
  const playerCard = engine.dealCard();
  const dealerCard = engine.dealCard();
  
  if (playerCard) playerCards.push(playerCard);
  if (dealerCard) dealerCards.push(dealerCard);
}
```

### **After (Correct)**
```typescript
// Correct: Alternating dealing
const playerCard1 = engine.dealCard();  // 1st card to player
const dealerCard1 = engine.dealCard();  // 2nd card to dealer
const playerCard2 = engine.dealCard();  // 3rd card to player
const dealerCard2 = engine.dealCard();  // 4th card to dealer

if (playerCard1) playerCards.push(playerCard1);
if (playerCard2) playerCards.push(playerCard2);
if (dealerCard1) dealerCards.push(dealerCard1);
if (dealerCard2) dealerCards.push(dealerCard2);
```
